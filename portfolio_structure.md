# Portfolio Structure

This document defines the high-level structure used to organise projects in this portfolio.

The goal is not to exhaustively categorise computer science, but to provide a **stable, future-proof framework** that makes it easy to understand what kind of work each project represents and how different areas of computer science relate to one another.

Projects may belong to more than one category.

---

## Automation & AI Systems

Projects in this category focus on building systems that automate tasks, make decisions, or augment human workflows using algorithms, artificial intelligence, or rule-based logic.

This includes:
- Task automation and workflow systems
- AI-assisted tools and decision-support systems
- Applied machine learning in practical contexts
- End-to-end systems rather than isolated models

The emphasis is on **integration and usefulness**, not on training models in isolation.

---

## Data & Analytics

This category includes projects that focus on working with data as a primary object.

This includes:
- Data collection, cleaning, and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis and visualisation
- Analytical pipelines and reporting systems
- Applying mathematical or statistical reasoning to real datasets

The focus is on extracting insight, ensuring data integrity, and communicating results clearly.

---

## Software Engineering Foundations

Projects here demonstrate core software engineering principles that apply across languages and domains.

This includes:
- Program structure and modularity
- Version control and collaboration workflows
- Testing, debugging, and maintainability
- Designing systems that are readable, extensible, and robust

These projects prioritise **engineering discipline** over novelty.

## Systems & Tooling

This category covers work that focuses on the underlying systems and tools that support software development and execution.

This includes:
- Operating system concepts and interactions
- Developer tooling and automation scripts
- Build systems and environment management
- Performance, reliability, and system behaviour

The emphasis is on understanding how software interacts with its environment.

---

## Algorithms & Computer Science Fundamentals

Projects in this category focus on the theoretical and foundational aspects of computer science, implemented in practice.

This includes:
- Algorithm design and analysis
- Data structures and computational complexity
- Mathematical reasoning in computation
- Translating theory into working implementations

These projects connect abstract concepts to concrete code.

---

## Cloud & Infrastructure

This category includes projects that involve deploying, managing, or reasoning about software in distributed or cloud-based environments.

This includes:
- Application deployment and configuration
- Infrastructure concepts and services
- Reliability, scalability, and availability concerns
- Observability and operational thinking

The focus is on making systems **work in real environments**, not just locally.

---

## Documentation & Technical Communication

Projects in this category emphasise clarity of explanation and communication as a technical skill.

This includes:
- Technical writing and documentation systems
- Explaining complex systems clearly
- Creating guides, diagrams, or structured learning materials
- Treating documentation as a first-class engineering artefact

Clear communication is treated as an essential part of professional computer science work.

## Category Usage

Each project listed in `project_registry.md` is tagged with one or more of the above categories.

Categories are intentionally broad to allow the portfolio to evolve without restructuring as tools, languages, and technologies change.
