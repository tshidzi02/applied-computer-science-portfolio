# Project Registry

This document is the central index of all projects in this portfolio.

Each project is listed with:

- A clear name
- One or more categories from `portfolio_structure.md`
- A current status
- A concise description of purpose
- A link to its own repository (when applicable)

Projects are added deliberately and updated as they progress.

## Project Status Legend

- **Planned** – The project is defined but not yet started
- **In Progress** – Active development is underway
- **Complete** – The project is finished and documented

- Completed projects remain listed to show progression over time.
