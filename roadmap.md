## Medium-Term Focus

The medium-term focus expands breadth and system complexity.

Planned emphasis areas:
- Data-driven systems and analytics
- Algorithms and computational reasoning
- Systems-level understanding and tooling
- Introduction to cloud and infrastructure concepts

Projects in this phase may involve:
- Larger datasets
- Multi-component systems
- Performance, reliability, or scalability considerations
