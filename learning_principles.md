# Learning Principles

This document outlines the principles that guide how I choose projects, learn new concepts, and develop as a computer scientist.

The goal is not speed or breadth alone, but **durable understanding**, applied skill, and clear communication.

## Project Selection

Projects are chosen deliberately rather than opportunistically.

Each project must:
- Solve a concrete problem or explore a real system
- Demonstrate applied reasoning, not just tool usage
- Be scoped realistically for completion
- Fit clearly into one or more portfolio categories

I prioritise projects that teach transferable concepts over projects that showcase short-lived technologies.

## Learning Through Building

I learn most effectively by building systems end to end.

Rather than isolating theory from practice, I prefer to:
- Start with a clear problem or question
- Research relevant concepts and constraints
- Implement incrementally
- Reflect on design decisions and trade-offs

This approach ensures that theory is grounded in real implementation experience.

## Documentation as Engineering

Documentation is treated as a first-class engineering artefact.

For every project, I aim to document:
- The purpose of the project
- The reasoning behind design decisions
- The structure of the system
- What worked, what didn’t, and why

Clear documentation improves understanding, maintainability, and collaboration, and is an essential professional skill.

## Tool-Agnostic Thinking

While tools and languages change, underlying principles remain stable.

I focus on:
- Core computer science fundamentals
- System design patterns
- Clear abstractions
- Reasoning about trade-offs

Tools are chosen to serve the problem, not the other way around.

## Iterative Improvement

Projects are not treated as static artefacts.

I revisit and refine work as:
- My understanding deepens
- New constraints emerge
- Better design approaches become clear

Progression and reflection matter more than perfection.
