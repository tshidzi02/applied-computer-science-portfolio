# Applied Computer Science Portfolio

This repository is a long-term, curated portfolio of applied computer science work.

It serves as a **control centre** for my projects across automation, artificial intelligence, data, software engineering, systems, and core computer science fundamentals. Rather than hosting all source code, this repository organises, explains, and contextualises the work I build elsewhere.

Think of this repository as:
- A **map** of my technical work
- A **contract** describing how projects are chosen and documented
- A **single entry point** for understanding my progression as a computer scientist

## How to Navigate This Portfolio

This repository is intentionally lightweight and documentation-focused.

Each file has a specific role:

- **README.md**  
  Explains the purpose of the portfolio and how everything fits together.

- **portfolio_structure.md**  
  Defines the high-level categories of computer science work used to organise projects.

- **project_registry.md**  
  A living index of all projects, including their category, purpose, status, and links to their own repositories.

- **learning_principles.md**  
  Documents how I choose projects, how I learn new tools, and why I prioritise applied, well-documented work.

- **roadmap.md**  
  Outlines near-term, medium-term, and long-term focus areas to show intentional growth over time.

## What This Portfolio Represents

This portfolio reflects an approach to computer science that values:

- **Applied problem-solving over isolated demos**
- **Clear documentation as part of engineering**
- **Systems thinking instead of one-off scripts**
- **Progression and learning over perfection**

Projects are designed to be realistic, scoped, and explainable. Each one exists for a reason and demonstrates specific skills.

## What This Portfolio Is Not

- A single application
- A tutorial repository
- A dumping ground for experiments
- A list of unrelated GitHub links

Every project referenced here is intentionally selected and documented.

## Status

This portfolio is actively evolving.  
New projects are added deliberately, one at a time, as skills deepen and breadth increases.
