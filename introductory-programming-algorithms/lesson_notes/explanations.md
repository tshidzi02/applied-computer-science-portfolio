## Python Basics — Variables & Input

This lesson introduces variables as named storage locations
and shows how programs receive input from users.

Key ideas:
- Programs run top to bottom
- Input pauses execution
- Variables remember values
## Python Conditionals — if / else

This lesson teaches how programs make decisions
based on true or false conditions.

Indentation controls logic flow.
## Python Loops — for and while

Loops allow repetition.
For-loops repeat a known number of times.
While-loops repeat until a condition changes.
## Python Algorithms — Searching & Sorting

Algorithms are step-by-step problem-solving procedures.
Linear search checks each item one by one.
Bubble sort repeatedly swaps neighbouring elements.
## Python Games — Applying Logic

Games combine variables, loops, and conditionals
into one interactive program.
## Java Basics — First Program

Java programs must be compiled before running.
Execution starts in the main method.
